# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:value is the actual content in the array while the index is the placement of those values inside the array

Researched answer: An arrayis an indexed collection of component variables, called the elements of the array. The indexes are the value of an ordinal type, called the index type of the array

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:strings and arrays are the same in that they both hold value. They both can be indexed to find placement of certain elements inside of them. they differ in that strings are 0 indexed and start off at 0,1,2,3 and so on and arrays will start at 1. 

Researched answer:Arrays are used to group together data of the same type. A string is a sequence of characters, or it can be defined as a collection of objects of the char type data.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.

2. Classes: Classes are the blueprint or templates for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions.

3. React: React is JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Everything in React is a component. React components are independent and reusable pieces of code. Each component contains its own functionality and returns markup.
